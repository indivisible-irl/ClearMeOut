#### Previous code base:

I have migrated from an Eclipse/Ant build to an Android Studio (IDEA), Gradle build.  
I chose to move the relevant code across manually and start a clean repo. The previous code/repo still exists and [can be found here](https://github.com/indivisible-irl/ClearMeOut_Eclipse).
